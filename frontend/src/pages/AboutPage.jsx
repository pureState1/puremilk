            <p>
              PureState was born from a simple belief: everyone deserves clean, nutritious,
              and natural milk â€” just like our ancestors had. Our journey started with a
              group of farmers who cared deeply about the land, the animals, and your health.
            </p>
            <p>
              Today, we serve families across the region with milk that is free from hormones,
              preservatives, and stress. Straight from the udder to your doorstep.
