            <h2>1. Contract Farming</h2>
            <p>
              We partner with farmers under pre-agreed terms to grow high-quality crops or produce.
              Our system ensures planned procurement, technical support, and guaranteed buyback at fair prices.
              This builds trust, reduces market risk, and boosts productivity for farmers.

            <p>
              PureState promotes rural tourism by supporting farm stays, guided village visits,
              natural food trails, and traditional cooking sessions. This brings sustainable income
              to farmers and educates urban visitors about where their food comes from.

              and post-harvest handling. With on-call and onsite support, we ensure continuous learning.

            <p>
              We help set up essential farm infrastructure like:
              solar-powered sheds, organic input units, small-scale processing facilities,
              water conservation systems, and composting pits â€” empowering self-sufficient farming.
